# GettingCleaningDataCourseProject
 This is the course project for the Getting an Cleaning Data Coursera course
 
 
# Dataset
One of the most exciting areas in all of data science right now is wearable
computing - see for example this article . Companies like Fitbit, Nike, and 
Jawbone Up are racing to develop the most advanced algorithms to attract new 
users. The data linked to from the course website represent data collected from 
the accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone.

Here are the data for the project:

# Files
CodeBook.md a code book that modifies and updates the available codebooks with
the data to indicate all the variables and summaries calculated, along with 
units, and any other relevant information.

README.md The README that explains the analysis files is clear and 
understandable

run_analysis.R a script file that contains all the steps required for the
projecct:

Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each 
measurement. 
Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 
From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with
the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

finalData.txt is the exported final data after going through all the sequences
described above.
