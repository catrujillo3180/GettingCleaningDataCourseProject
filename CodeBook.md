The `run_analysis.R` script performs the data preparation and then followed
by the 5 steps required as described in the course projectâ€™s definition.

1. Download the dataset
    * Dataset downloaded and extracted under the folder called `UCI HAR Dataset`
within folder `data` in currently work directory

2. REading all data to variables
    * `features`
    * `activities`
    * `subject_test`
    * `x_test`
    * `y_test`
    * `subject_train`
    * `x_train`
    * `y_train`

3. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set
    * `x` is created by merging `x_train` and `x_test` using `rbind()` function
    * `y` is created by merging `y_train` and `y_test` using `rbind()` function
    * `subject` is created by merging `subject_train` and `subject_test` using 
    `rbind()` function
    * Finally, `mergedData` is created by merging `subject`, `y` and `x` using 
    `cbind()` function

4. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each
measurement
    *`tidyData` is created by subsetting mergedData, selecting only columns: 
    subject, code and the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for 
    each measurement

5. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
    * Entire numbers in code column of the `tidyData` replaced with 
    corresponding activity taken from second column of the `activities` variable

6. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names
    * `code` column in `tidyData` renamed into `activities`
    * All `Acc` in columns name replaced by `Accelerometer`
    * All `Gyro` in columns name replaced by `Gyroscope`
    * All `BodyBody` in columns name replaced by `Body`
    * All `Ma`g in columns name replaced by `Magnitude`
    * All start with character `f` in columns name replaced by `Frequency`
    * All start with character `t` in columns name replaced by `Time`

7. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set 
with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject
    * `finalData` is created by summarizing `tidyData` taking the means of each
    variable for each activity and each subject, after grouped by subject and 
    activity.
    * Export `finalData` into `finalData.txt` file.
